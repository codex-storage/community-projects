# Awesome Codex
Repo of community-driven Codex projects

| Name (link)| Description |
| ----- | ------ |
| [ethCC demo](https://github.com/codex-storage/ethcc-demo) | Shows storage requests as they are created on the testnet (or locally, depending on config), and assuming the dataset is an image, displays the image |
| [Qaku](https://github.com/vpavlin/qaku) | [Qaku.app](https://qaku.app) is a Q&A app (like Slido, but decentralized), leaning on Codex for persistency of the Q&As. Codex REST API is used via codex-js in the [frontend](https://github.com/vpavlin/qaku) and from Go in the [backend](https://github.com/vpavlin/qaku-cache)  |
